## Profile
I am a PhD student in Economics at the Institute for International Economic Studies (IIES), Stockholm University.  
My research spans macroeconomics, industrial organization, and information economics, with an emphasis on how market structure and information frictions shape growth and inequality.

## Research interests
- Macroeconomics of innovation and growth  
- Industrial organization and competition policy  
- Information economics, rational inattention, and heterogeneous information  
- Family economics: marriage markets and wealth inequality

## Current projects
- **Marriage markets and wealth inequality.** Non-unitary household decisions and heterogeneous asset returns in a perpetual-youth GE setting.  
- **Nonhomothetic demand and innovation dynamics.** Demand-driven incentives to climb quality/productivity ladders and poverty-trap mechanisms.  
- **Directed search in technology and patent markets.** Matching, bargaining, and equilibrium pricing across technology submarkets.  
- **Tax policy and R&D investment.** WACC, cost of capital, and innovation responses.

## Methods
Dynamic programming, heterogeneous-agent computation, EGM, finite-difference ODEs, system identification, and structural IO tools.  
Coding in Python, MATLAB, and R.

## Teaching and service
Teaching assistant and reading-group organizer in macro/IO topics at Stockholm University.
