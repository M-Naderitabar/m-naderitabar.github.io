## Profile
I am a PhD student in Economics at the Institute for International Economic Studies (IIES), Stockholm University.  
My research focuses on the interaction between macroeconomic dynamics, market structure, firm behavior, and household decision-making, with applications to growth and wealth inequality.

## Research interests
- Macroeconomics of innovation and growth  
- Industrial organization and competition policy  
- Heterogeneous-agent macroeconomic models  
- Family economics: marriage markets and wealth inequality

## Current projects
- **Marriage markets and wealth inequality.** A non-unitary, incomplete-market framework with heterogeneous asset returns and Nash bargaining within households.
- **Tax policy and investment behavior.** Studying how taxation shapes firmsâ€™ investment and innovation decisions through WACC and capital structure.
- **Analyzing Economic Systems.** Developing a structural framework to study interlinked economic mechanisms using dynamic modeling and system identification.
- **Demand, firm upgrading, and growth.** Exploring how nonhomothetic demand and firm upgrading interact to drive innovation and aggregate productivity.

<!-- ## Methods
Dynamic programming, heterogeneous-agent computation, EGM, finite-difference ODEs, system identification, and structural IO tools.  
Coding in Python, MATLAB, and R. -->

## Teaching
- **Math II (Graduate, Stockholm University).** Teaching assistant for Professors Tessa Bold and Paul Klein.  
- **Macroeconomics I (Graduate, Stockholm University).** Teaching assistant for Professors Timo Boppart and Lars Ljungqvist.
